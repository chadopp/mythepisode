*Note:*
If your paths differ from mine above then you will have to make a few changes to paths in 
a couple of scripts.  I plan to fix this in the future.
- grabid.pl
- runwish
- handler.php

*Note:* 
If it takes a long time to load the main page try setting $getrecorded to 0 in handler.php.  If you do this I think the page will load faster but shows that you have recorded won't show up in green on the main page.

*Note:*  
When you do an "Update listing" either for the shows or episodes please be patient as it is going out to tvrage and updating the information.  Generally updating the "Show Listing" is fairly quick(less than 30 seconds).  The more episodes a show has the longer it takes to gather summary information.  A show like "General Hospital" that has 5000 episodes can take forever.  I don't recommend updating shows like this very often.  It can take up to an hour.  If you have an account with tvrage I have a script that makes grabbing summaries much much faster.  For instance, a show like "General Hospital" that takes up to an hour can be reduced to less than a minute.
